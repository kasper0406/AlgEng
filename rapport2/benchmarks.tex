\subsection{Test setup}

Our program was written in C/C++ and compiled with Clang. All memory allocations were cache line boundary aligned.

\todo{Tjek at det rent faktisk ogsaa er gjort.}

All benchmarks were performed on a Linux desktop which has 4 GB ram and a Core i3 550 CPU with the following specification:

\begin{itemize}
\item 2 * 3.2 GHz (no Turbo boost)
\item 2 * 32 KB L1 instruction cache
\item 2 * 32 KB L1 data cache
\item 2 * 256 KB L2 cache
\item Shared 4 MB L3 cache
\item 64 byte cache lines
\item Inclusive caches
\item The associativity for the cache levels are 8, 8 and 16 respectively

\end{itemize}

L2 cache faults and L3 cache faults were measured using Intel Performance Monitor Counter while branch mispredictions were measured using PAPI.

All tests were performed 5 times and the median was selected. The data in the matrices were randomly generated double precision floating points with
an uniform distribution. The range of the data was 0 to
10,000.
