In this section we will describe the different algorithms and memory
layouts we have used.

\subsection{Simple multiplication}
We started out implementing the simple conventional matrix
multiplication algorithm where we stored the matrices using a row
based layout.

Expectations of cache faults here....
We do not expect any significant amount of branch mispredictions.

In order to improve the number of cache faults, we have tried to use a
column base layout in the right operand in the multiplication. We
expect this to give us a bit better cache performance. This approach
has the drawback of limiting a matrix only to be used on one side of a
multiplication.
