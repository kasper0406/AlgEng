For binary search, binary DFS and binary BFS our expectations are a similar number of branch mispredictions. In accordance with our predicted cache fault formulas, we expect to see more cache faults in binary search compared to binary BFS and more cache faults in binary BFS than in binary DFS.

We would also expect the blocked layouts to have fewer cache faults than the binary layouts. And if the block size is equal to the cacheline size then BFS and DFS should perform equally. A block size smaller than the cacheline size is expected to perform slightly better with a DFS layout compared to a BFS layout.
