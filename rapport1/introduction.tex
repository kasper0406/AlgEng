The purpose of the following rapport is to demonstrate that the complexity of algorithms depends heavily on the hardware the algorithm is running on. Cache faults, branch predictions etc. influences the performance to a great degree.

The problem under test is a set $S$ containing $N$ integers which supports the following query:

\begin{eqnarray*}
\mathrm{Pred}(x) = \max \{ y \in S\ |\ y \leq x \}
\end{eqnarray*}
